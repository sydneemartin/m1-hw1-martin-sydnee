## About Me
My name is Sydnee Martin and I am from Winchester, VA. I am a first time dog owner of a three-year old dog named Harlow! I received my Bachelors from George Washington University in American Studies and set to graduate May 2025 from University of Florida with my Masters in Communications, Global Strategic Communications.

## Career Goals
1. Move up promotional in current role
2. Enter into a field involving urban community forestry and engaging with communities.
3. Build and restart photography business.

## Past Coding Experience
Unfortunately, my coding experience is nonexistent, but I am hoping to take this course to gain an understanding of web development and perhaps down the road creating the beginning stages of website/blog for my mom's company, however much beginning principles will allow.
